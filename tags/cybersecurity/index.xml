      <description>small preamble about how this is just me talking right into the void its just a way to note a checklist to track what i still need to do
also, i didnt feel like formatting this one so fuck you future me
password management pw manager, use different, random passwords for everything
Backups (incl. offsite server) store important data (especially the pw database) on backup drives. setup a small offsite server (like a raspberry pi with a harddrive attached) as an offsite backup, so in case of fire or something that destroys your data at home you dont lose all your passwords / accounts also print out your pw db for exmample from time to time.</description>
